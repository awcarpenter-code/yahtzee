# YAHTZEE
Yahtzee is a popular multi-player dice game. The objective is to maximize your score by rolling five dice to make certain combinations. A game consists of 13 rounds, with each player getting one turn in each round. Each player’s turn consists of an initial roll of all 5 dice, followed by up to 2 additional rolls. Before making a second or third roll, a player can opt to ‘save’ dice that will not be re-rolled, or ‘unsave’ dice.

The score card has 13 possible scoring categories with an associated description and weight, plus a Yahtzee bonus count (0 to 3). More complete descriptions are listed below.
At the end of a turn, a player must choose to score a category on their scorecard. This category cannot be chosen again in this game. This ends the player’s turn.

# Scoring
# Upper section
• Ones : Receive 1 point for each 1 rolled

• Twos : Receive 2 points for each 2 rolled

• Threes : Receive 3 points for each 3 rolled

• Fours : Receive 4 points for each 4 rolled

• Fives : Receive 5 points for each 5 rolled

• Sixes : Receive 6 points for each 6 rolled

# Lower section
• Three of a Kind If there are three dice of the same number, add up all the spots on all the dice

• Four of a Kind If there are four dice of the same number, add up all the spots on all the dice

• Full House Three dice showing the same number, and two dice showing another number, scores 25 points.

• Small Straight Any four consecutive numbers (for example, 3-4-5-6), scores 30 points Large Straight Any five consecutive numbers (for example, 2-3-4-5-6), scores 40 points

• Yahtzee (or Five of a Kind) All 5 dice showing the same number, scores 50 points (see note below)

• Chance Any combination of dice, add up all the spots on all the dice

It’s possible that a player will end up with a combination of dice that could be used in more than one category. For example, a roll of 3-3-3-4-4 could be scored as threes or fours in the Upper Section, or as a Full House or a Three-Of-A-Kind, or Chance in the Lower Section. The player has the option of scoring the dice in any one of those categories as long as they have not been used previously in the game.
If a player’s final roll does not score points for any remaining category, they must choose a category with a score of 0, and that category cannot be used again.

# Yahtzee Bonus
If a player rolls a Yahtzee on their turn and they have already filled in the Yahtzee category (but did not zero it) in a previous turn, they receive a Yahtzee bonus. If the player throws a Yahtzee but have filled the Yahtzee category with a score of 0, they do not get a Yahtzee bonus. The player should select the Yahtzee category for each Yahtzee. At the end of the game, each Yahtzee bonus is worth 100 points. Scoring a Yahtzee bonus constitutes a complete turn.
